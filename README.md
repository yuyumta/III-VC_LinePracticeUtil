# III-VC_LinePracticeUtil
Important: I've more-or-less abandoned this project, as opposed to the SA version, which I've updated several times since its release. There are at least two problems present in the current version, most notable of which being that the tool ceases to work after you save, or something, I forgot. It's been quite a while. In any case, I'm lazy, and I probably won't fix any of the issues unless I spontaneously develop a desire to run either of the two, or unless someone explicitly asks me to.

Two asi plugins for GTA III and GTA: Vice City that help practice stuff. 

# How to use
1. Ensure the correct plugin is installed.
2. Load the game and enter a vehicle.
3. Press the tab key. You've now set a 'vehicle point'.
4. Press 1. You've now teleported to the 'vehicle point' you've set.
5. Exit the vehicle and press 1. You've now teleported to the 'vehicle point' you've set from on-foot.
6. Exit the vehicle again and press tab. You've now set an 'on-foot point'.
7. Press 2. You've now teleported to the 'on-foot point' you've set.

2. Install an asi loader if needed.
3. Put the asi file in the root directory of the game.
4. Profit.
